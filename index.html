  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p><strong>"Stay close to what feels like sunshine."</strong></p>
  <p>Hi! My name is Yuelha Yeshey Tshogyal and I was born on the 20th of August, 2011 on a very sunny day! I completed my primary education at Sersang Primary School and Thimphu Primary School, which are both located in Thimphu. I am currently studying in the 9th grade at <strong>The Royal Academy, Paro, Pangbesa</strong>. I have a younger sister who is currently studying in the 4th grade at Druk School, Thimphu.</p>
  <p>I also have a stepsister, who is currently studying in the 9th grade at Lungtenzampa Higher Secondary School, Thimphu.</p>
  <p>Growing up, I have always been very enthusiastic about reading. I love reading different genres of books such as history, romance, and mystery. I also love playing chess. It helps me think clearly, focus better, and make smart decisions. Chess also teaches me patience, planning, and solving problems, and I can use these skills in school and everyday life. I also like reading tarot cards. It may sound weird at first, but it’s something I really enjoy because it helps me reflect on different situations and think deeply. Reading tarot encourages me to use my intuition, consider different perspectives, and explore creative ways of thinking. It’s also a fun and relaxing activity that inspires curiosity and self-reflection, and it gives me a way to connect with my thoughts and ideas in a meaningful way.</p>
  <p>I really enjoy watching football because it’s exciting, teaches me strategy, and inspires me with teamwork and skill. My favourite football club is FC Barcelona, one of the biggest football clubs in the world. I love watching their matches because their style of play is exciting and full of skill. I enjoy seeing how the players work together as a team and score amazing goals. Following Barcelona has made me more interested in football and has taught me the value of teamwork, practice, and never giving up. My favourite football player is Frenkie De Jong. I really like Frenkie de Jong because he is an amazing football player with great skills and intelligence on the field. I enjoy watching how he controls the ball, passes accurately, and helps his team both in attack and defense. His calmness under pressure and ability to make smart decisions during matches inspire me. Frenkie De Jong is not only talented but also works hard and shows dedication, which makes him my favorite player to watch. </p>

    <summary> Folktale Project</summary>
    <p>In our folktale project, the 7 of us created a white paper on collecting Buddhist folktales on astronomy and turning them into a children’s illustrated storybook. It teaches kids about the sky, moon, planets, and constellations, while preserving Bhutanese cultural knowledge like the lunar calendar and zodiac animals.</p>

    <summary> MIC Abstract (Mission Idea Contest)</summary>
    <p>My team and I created a proposal for MIC 2026: a Night-Sky Storytelling & Astrophotography Experience. Using satellite-based weather data and sky-visibility forecasts, the project blends science with Bhutanese cultural knowledge to guide people in exploring constellations, planets, and seasonal sky patterns.</p>
    <p>It includes storytelling sessions, astrophotography events, and a digital/print night-sky catalogue to help schools, youth groups, and tourists plan their stargazing.</p>

  <h1>My Life at TRA</h1>
  <p>The Bhutan Baccalaureate Learning Process is a distinctive educational framework designed to develop well-rounded individuals, or "Persons of Substance," who are deeply rooted in their cultural heritage yet adaptable to a changing world. This process emphasizes the importance of contextual learning, drawing from the strengths of specific contexts, circumstances, and communities. It encourages students to become self-directed learners, capable of using a variety of resources and engaging thoughtfully with the world. The learning process is not solely focused on academic achievement but rather on building life skills and understanding the processes of learning. It supports the development of students in five key areas: Cerebral, Emotional, Physical, Social, and Spiritual, ensuring a holistic approach to education.</p>

  <p>The Royal Academy is a key component of the Druk Gyalpo's Institute, established to provide high-quality, holistic education. It was the first school to implement the Bhutan Baccalaureate Learning Process, focusing on serving students from marginalized sections of society. The Academy aims to foster a balanced and diverse student community, representing all 20 Dzongkhags of Bhutan, and plays a crucial role in the ongoing development and expansion of the Bhutan Baccalaureate.</p>

  <p>The Royal Academy operates on a scholarship basis, which means that students admitted to the school receive scholarships to cover their educational expenses. This approach is particularly significant as it ensures that education at The Royal Academy is accessible to students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, including those who are socio-economically vulnerable. The scholarship covers the full cost of education, including tuition, boarding, and other necessary expenses, allowing students to focus on their studies without the burden of financial constraints. This inclusivity is fundamental to the Academy's mission of providing high-quality education to promising students from all over Bhutan, particularly those who might not have the means to afford such education otherwise.</p>

  <p>To study at The Royal Academy, students must go through a specific admission process that begins with their participation in the Winter Camp. Here’s a breakdown of the steps involved:</p>

  <p><strong>1. National Character Representation:</strong> Each year, 120 students from all 20 Dzongkhags are nominated by their respective Dzongkhag Administrations to attend the Winter Camp. These students are typically from socio-economically vulnerable backgrounds and have completed Grade VI.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Online Application:</strong> In addition to the nominated students, 30 meritorious students who have achieved at least a 90% aggregate in Grade VI can apply through an open online application to attend the Winter Camp.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Winter Camp:</strong> During this camp, students participate in various activities and assessments that evaluate their potential across the Five Areas of Development: Cerebral, Emotional, Physical, Social, and Spiritual.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Selection for Admission:</strong> After the Winter Camp, 60 students are selected for admission and scholarships. This includes 40 students (two from each Dzongkhag) and 20 from the remaining group.</p>
  <p><strong>5. Confirmation and Transition:</strong> Once selected, the students and their families are informed, and arrangements are made for their transition to The Royal Academy.</p>

  <p>When I was in the 5th grade, my aunt used to tell me to try for The Royal Academy. At first I did not take it seriously, but in grade 6, after repeated words from my aunt telling me to apply for the winter camp, I decided to give it a try. I applied for the winter camp and unexpectedly got accepted. The winter camp took place from 29th December - 4th January. It was tough being away from family for that long as a student who has been a day scholar her whole life, and especially to celebrate new years without any family, but with the friends I made in winter camp, I felt a sense of belonging and warmth that eased the homesickness. We shared laughter, stories, and small traditions, creating memories that made me realize how important friendships can be in building a second family away from home. That experience taught me independence, and the joy of connecting with others even in unfamiliar places.</p>

  <p>After the winter camp, I went back home and shared all the stories that my new friends told me to my family, and I told my family about my experience in winter camp. Less than a month later, my aunt received the email that changed my life. She got an email that said I was accepted to The Royal Academy. I was honestly really surprised, but at the same time I was super excited to go to a new school filled with people from different districts in Bhutan. I had to report to school on February 12th 2023, and words cannot even express how cold it was. I also met a lot of my friends who I made during winter camp that were now my new batch mates! It was tough settling down at first, but the school kept us so busy and made us do so many activities that I completely forgot the feeling of homesickness. Of course during weekends I felt homesick, but I had amazing friends who felt like my second family.</p>

  <p>I am in the 9th grade now, and when I look back, I think of how little I was back then (well, I’m still the same height!). Back then, my biggest dream was to be like the grade 9 achos and azhims, and now I can hardly believe that I’ve reached the grade I always thought was the coolest. I wonder if my juniors ever look up to me and my batchmates the way I looked up to our seniors. I am grateful for my amazing group of five friends who always have my back no matter what, they truly are the best friends ever! Of course, life has its ups and downs, but every challenge shapes us into who we are meant to become. I also want to thank my aunt, whose support and guidance has helped me become the person I am today.</p>
